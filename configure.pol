# CS 6250 Fall 2025 - SDN Firewall Project with POX
# build gibson-29
#
# This file contains the rules for the firewall as specified in the Project Documentation.  
#
# Rule Format:
# RuleNumber,Action,Source MAC,Destination MAC,Source IP,Destination IP,Protocol,Source Port,Destination Port,Comment/Note
# RuleNumber = this is a rule number to help you track a particular rule - it is not used in the firewall implementation
# Action = Block or Allow , Allow Rules need to take precedence over Block Rules
# Source / Destination MAC address in form of xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
# Source / Destination IP Address in form of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx in CIDR notation
# Protocol = integer IP protocol number per IANA (0-254)
# Source / Destination Port = if Protocol is TCP or UDP, this is the Application Port Number per IANA
# Comment/Note = this is for your use in tracking rules.
#
# Any field not being used for a match should have a '-' character as it's entry (except for RuleNumber/Comment)
# Do not pad any of the entries (i.e., have a rule like:  1, Block, -, -,...)
#
# Warning:  For the IP address, you need to specify an appropriate network address
# that matches the subnet mask you are using.  For instance, if you want to use a /16
# subnet mask, then the IP address must be x.x.0.0.  For example, a proper address to 
# reference a 192.168.10.x/24 network would be 192.168.10.0/24.  A single host
# is addressed as a single IP address with a /32.  In other words, the host bit for a 
# subnet other than /32 must be 0.
#
# Example Rules:
# 1,Block,-,-,10.0.0.1/32,10.0.1.0/24,6,-,80,Block 10.0.0.1 from accessing a web server on the 10.0.1.0/24 network
# 2,Allow,-,-,10.0.0.1/32,10.0.1.125/32,6,-,80,Allow 10.0.0.1 to access a web server on 10.0.1.125 overriding previous rule

# Task 1:
1,Block,-,-,10.0.30.4/32,-,6,-,-,Block cn4 from initiating any TCP traffic

# Task 2:
2,Block,-,-,10.0.30.5/32,-,-,-,-,Block cn5 from initiating any outgoing traffic
3,Block,-,-,-,10.0.30.5/32,-,-,-,Block cn5 from receiving any incoming traffic

# Task 3:
4,Block,-,-,-,-,1,-,-,Block all ICMP globally
5,Allow,-,-,-,10.0.0.0/24,1,-,-,Allow ICMP ping from all to hq
6,Allow,-,-,10.0.0.0/24,-,1,-,-,Allow ICMP ping from hq to all

# Task 4:
10,Block,-,-,10.0.30.3/32,-,6,80,-,Block cn3 HTTP responses
11,Block,-,-,10.0.30.3/32,-,6,443,-,Block cn3 HTTPS responses

# Task 5:
12,Block,-,-,10.0.40.128/30,10.0.1.32/30,6,-,9520,Block tcp connection from uk2-5 to us3-4 on port 9520
13,Block,-,-,10.0.20.124/30,10.0.1.32/30,6,-,9520,Block tcp connection from in4-5 to us3-4 on port 9520
14,Block,-,-,10.0.1.125/32,10.0.1.32/30,6,-,9520,Block tcp connection from us5 to us3-4 on port 9520
15,Block,-,-,10.0.0.220/32,10.0.1.32/30,6,-,9520,Block tcp connection from hq5 to us3-4 on port 9520

# Task 6:

18,Block,-,-,-,10.0.1.0/24,6,-,25,Block tcp from all to us on port 25
19,Block,-,-,-,10.0.20.0/24,6,-,25,Block tcp from all to in on port 25
20,Block,-,-,-,10.0.30.0/24,6,-,25,Block tcp from all to cn on port 25
